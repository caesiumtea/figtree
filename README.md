# The Fig Tree

The Fig Tree is a helper site for the pet game [Figment](https://figment.pet/). This repo is the source code for the website, which you can visit at  [thefigtree.netlify.app](https://thefigtree.netlify.app/).

This project serves the dual purpose of helping out the Figment community with some references and utilities to make navigating the game a little easier, while also giving me a place to practice as I grow my skills in web development. The site is planned to gradually increase in complexity over several phases; feel free to browse the Projects tab for notes on what I'm working on and planning for future releases of the site. At the moment it's just a link list on a little skeleton of a site, but I aim to eventually develop it into a full CRUD app with user accounts, where folks can save custom lists of Figment items/pets and search for trading partners.

All feedback is heartily welcomed, constructive criticism especially.

Next phase: Lists of items with links to which shop page they can be purchased on.
